# Understanding 
In this project I made use of Context API for transfer of data between different components
Learned to use hooks in react
Pizzas are loaded directly from the database as well as from a json file.
Used various libraries, utilised MDB, MUI, custom css etc.
Did password hashing using bcrypt for logging in and verifying user
This also enables us to add Pizzas directly to the database.
There is also a sign in page for users to register themselves.


# Backend 
Backend of the project was made using ExpressJS connected to mongoDB

Making UI better and more fluid
